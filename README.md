# Analyzing sum-scores with linear, logistic, and beta-binomial rewgression models

Sum scores, the sum of scores on Likert scale items, are sometimes analysed with linear or regressions, or by dichotomizing and logistic regressions. The [beta-binomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-binomial_distribution) model is preferable because it is more consistent with the data generating process, but it's implementation is less straight forward. To see if the extrat effort is worth it, this repository compares linear and logistic regressions with the beta-binomal regression.
